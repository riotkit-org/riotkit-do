RiotKit-Do (RKD) usage and development manual
=============================================

RKD is a stable, open-source, multi-purpose automation tool which balance flexibility with simplicity. The primary language is Python
and YAML syntax.

RiotKit-Do can be compared to **Gradle** and to **GNU Make**, by allowing both Python and Makefile-like YAML syntax.

**What I can do with RKD?**

- Simplify the scripts
- Put your Python and Bash scripts inside a YAML file (like in GNU Makefile)
- Do not reinvent the wheel (argument parsing, logs, error handling for example)
- Share the code across projects and organizations, use native Python Packaging to share tasks (like in Gradle)
- Natively integrate scripts with .env files
- Automatically generate documentation for your scripts
- Maintain your scripts in a good standard

**RKD can be used on PRODUCTION, for development, for testing, to replace some of Bash scripts inside docker containers,
and for many more, where Makefile was used.**

Example use cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Docker based production environment with multiple configuration files, procedures (see: `Harbor project <https://github.com/riotkit-org/riotkit-harbor>`_)
- Database administrator workspace (importing dumps, creating new user accounts, plugging/unplugging databases)
- Development environment (executing migrations, importing test database, splitting tests and running parallel)
- On CI (prepare project to run on eg. Jenkins or Gitlab CI) - RKD is reproducible on local computer which makes inspection easier
- Kubernetes/OKD deployment workspace (create shared YAML parts with JINJA2 between multiple environments and deploy from RKD)
- Automate things like certificate regeneration on production server, RKD can generate any application configs using JINJA2
- Installers (RKD has built-in commands for replacing lines in files, modifying .env files, asking user questions and validating answers)

Install RKD
~~~~~~~~~~~

RiotKit-Do is delivered as a Python package that can be installed system-wide or in a virtual environment.
The virtual environment installation is similar in concept to the Gradle wrapper (gradlew)

.. code:: bash

    # 1) via PIP
    pip install rkd

    # 2) Create project (will create a virtual env and commit files to GIT)
    rkd :rkd:create-structure --commit


Getting started in freshly created structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "Quick start" section ends up with a **.rkd** directory, a requirements.txt and ./rkdw

1. Call RKD using a wrapper in project directory **./rkdw**
2. Each time you install anything from **pip** in your project - add it to requirements.txt (or Pipfile), you can install additional RKD tasks from pip
3. In **.rkd/makefile.yaml** add your first tasks, pipelines and imports

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- YAML syntax is described also in :ref:`Tasks development` section
- Writing Python code in makefile.yaml requires to lookup :ref:`Tasks API`
- Learn how to import installed tasks via pip - :ref:`Importing tasks`
- You can also write tasks code in pure Python and redistribute those tasks via Python's PIP - see :ref:`Tasks development`
- With RKD you can create interactive installers - check the :ref:`Wizard` section
